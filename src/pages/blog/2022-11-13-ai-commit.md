Commit messages can be tedious to come up with and I found a better way (for me at least) to do it, so here's how I do git commits by just hitting CMD-enter in VS Code. AI generates the commit message and to be frank, it does a better job than me at it

1.  Install auto-commit with:

        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1guelpf/auto-commit/main/install.sh | sh -

2.  add OpenAI API key to .zshrc (or whatever terminal you're using)

        export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-XXXXXXXX'

3.  create a file called auto-push.sh and make sure it's location is in your path

        git add . && \
        auto-commit && \
        git push

(if you want to include deletes in your commits as well use git add -A instead of git add .)

4.  Use the "Command Runner" extension in Visual Studio Code" and add this shortcut to preference > keyboard shortcuts:

        {
        "key": "cmd+enter",
        "label": "generate commit and push",
        "command": "command-runner.run",
        "args": {"command": "sh auto-push.sh"},
        "when": "editorTextFocus"
        }

Make some changes to your code and hit CMD+enter. Auto-commit will make a suggestion for the commit message and if you're satisfied just hit Y
