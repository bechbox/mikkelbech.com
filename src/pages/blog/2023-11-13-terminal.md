### Nerd alert!

If you don't know what "terminal" or "shell" means in computer lingo, this post won't make you any wiser, just move along ðŸ¤¡

Back when I studied Computer Science hacking the Unix shell to fit your needs was a must, this was back when different Linux distributions with a GUI became widespread available. Since shifting to Macs many years ago I just got used to using the default terminal and maybe tweaking colors and fonts a bit, so my term would look like this:

## Enter the Bullet Train

I don't know why I didn't do anything about this situation and/or wasn't aware, that of course you can hack your shell on a Mac too. Luckily my dev team is of course well on top of things like this, so I finally to up to speed, and now I'm using [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to customize the shell, and most importantly this allows me to use [Bullet Train](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh) theme. This is a GODSEND - instead of the uniform look of the default Terminal look, there's now a clear separation of commands, and look at all that useful information in each command line! It tells me when the command fires, what the path is, what version of Node and finally what branch I'm on and other usefull Git info. Thanks [Emento](https://www.emento.dk) Dev Team ðŸ˜ƒ
