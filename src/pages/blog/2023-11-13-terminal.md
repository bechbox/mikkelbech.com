### Calling All Computer Nerds!

Are you unfamiliar with the terms "terminal" or "shell" in the world of computing? If so, you might find this post a bit arcane. But for the curious, stick around, you might just discover something intriguing! ðŸš€

Rewind to my university days studying Computer Science. Back then, customizing the Unix shell was almost a rite of passage, especially as Linux distributions with graphical interfaces began gaining traction. After switching to Macs, I settled into the comfort of the default terminal, occasionally dabbling in font and color tweaks. My setup looked somewhat like this:

## Discovering the Bullet Train

For the longest time, I didn't realize or explore the possibilities of shell customization on a Mac. Thankfully, my savvy development team was ahead of the curve. They introduced me to the wonders of [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), a framework for Zsh customization, and the [Bullet Train](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh) theme. It was a game-changer!

Gone are the days of the monotonous default Terminal. Now, each command line is a tapestry of useful information, neatly separated for clarity. It displays the command execution time, the current path, Node version, Git branch, and other essential Git details. A big shoutout to the [Emento](https://www.emento.dk) Dev Team for this fantastic upgrade! ðŸ˜ƒ
